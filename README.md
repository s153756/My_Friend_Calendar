Project Overview
This repository contains two main parts: backend/ – Python-based backend, and frontend/ – web frontend application. Both are stored in separate folders to keep the project modular and maintainable.

Branch Naming Convention
Branches must follow this pattern: <task-number>-<short-description>
Example: 123-add-user-auth

Coding Standards
The backend must follow standard Python coding conventions, including PEP 8 styling, clear and maintainable code structure, use of type hints where appropriate, and meaningful commit messages.

Code Review Process
The current Product Manager must be assigned as the reviewer.
When the merge request is ready, add the label: ready_to_review

Running the Project
Instructions for running the backend and frontend are located in their respective folders.
